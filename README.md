## What is this?

Currently I don't really have anything to put here, but there'll probably be some static file hosting [here](https://files.feny.me/) and maybe some programming experiments [here](https://lab.feny.me). I might even add some devlogs or something if I have enough time.

## How did I make it?

I don't feel like using React so I'm currently using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to make this homepage. It's hosted with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com). Honestly this is just filler text at this point I just don't want my website to be completely empty.
